### Processing Steps for an AOI System

This AOI system detects defects in manufactured capsules using OpenCV. The main processing steps are outlined below:

1. **Image Acquisition**
   Capture high-resolution images of the capsules using cameras. Ensure consistent lighting and positioning to reduce variations in the input data.

2. **Preprocessing**

   - Convert images to grayscale to simplify processing.
   - Apply noise reduction techniques (e.g., Gaussian blur, median filtering) to improve image quality.
   - Enhance contrast using histogram equalization or CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization).

3. **Segmentation**

   - Separate capsules from the background using thresholding techniques (e.g., global, adaptive, or Otsu's thresholding).
   - Alternatively, use edge-detection methods like Canny Edge Detection for more complex contours.

4. **Feature Extraction**

   - Detect and measure visual features such as size, shape, texture, or color.
   - Use contour detection to locate and analyze capsule boundaries or defects.

5. **Defect Detection**

   - Compare extracted features against predefined standards or templates to identify irregularities.
   - Use methods such as template matching, blob detection, or morphological operations to detect scratches, cracks, or other anomalies.

6. **Classification (Optional)**

   - Use machine learning models (e.g., SVM, k-NN) or deep learning (e.g., CNNs) to classify defects if rule-based methods are insufficient.

7. **Postprocessing**

   - Highlight detected defects in the output image for visualization.
   - Generate statistical reports or send defect information to the manufacturing control system.

8. **Integration and Deployment**
   - Optimize the code for real-time processing.
   - Integrate the system with factory hardware for automated operation, ensuring robustness and reliability.
